# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yuriodilon

###### I have been programming for a few good years, but I never developed in depth, 
###### I recently made the decision to develop precisely because of my passion for the 
###### financial market, when I came across the platform and the possibility of developing 
###### algorithms and solutions for the market, it was ready to match.
